# Dookie-Grundle
My own very first project.
I have very little idea of what I am doing. I still do not understand what github is, or why it is useful. I am brand new to coding. Like infant brand new. But if I look back on my life and my experience with computers, coding, and just general behind the screen time, I am a master. I should be a master of something computer based by now, but I am not. I am a jack of all trades. And today, in these troubled times, that just does not work. You've got to specialize in something to make any money or to matter to anyone at all. I know a little about everything and can do almost anything, especially if I like it and put my mind to it, but I have yet to find that subject. Hopefully coding is it. Maybe hacking code once I learn to master it. Here goes nothing, and yet, here goes everything.
